<p>It is no secret that the Minnesota Timberwolves are a team on the rise. Led by Jimmy Butler and Karl-Anthony Towns, the Timberwolves have a bright future ahead of them. With their young talent and solid players like Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, and Jamal Crawford, the Timberwolves are one of the most exciting teams in the NBA.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Betting</p>
<p>In light of their recent success, many people are betting on the Timberwolves to win the Super Bowl. The odds currently favor them at 4/1, making them one of the favorites to win it all. If you’re looking to place a bet on the Timberwolves, now is definitely the time to do so.</p>
<p>Why They Can Win It All</p>
<p>The Timberwolves have a lot of things going for them. Not only do they have some of the best young players in the league, but they also have a great head coach in Tom Thibodeau. Thibodeau is a proven winner, having won an NBA Championship with the Chicago Bulls in 2010-2011. He knows how to get the most out of his players and will undoubtedly be able to lead the Timberwolves deep into the playoffs.</p>
<p>What’s more, the Timberwolves have a very favorable schedule in 2018-2019. They don’t have any matchups against last year’s finalists (the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers), nor do they have any matchups against this year’s top contenders (the Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics). This gives them a great opportunity to make a run at the championship.</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Timberwolves-a-Popular-Pick-for-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Minnesota-Timberwolves-a-Popular-Pick-for-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Timberwolves a Popular Pick for Super Bowl"></a>Minnesota Timberwolves a Popular Pick for Super Bowl</h1><p>With the Minnesota Timberwolves a popular pick for Super Bowl LII, the team is preparing for the big game.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves’ defense is also among the best in the NBA. They are led by veterans like Taj Gibson and Jimmy Butler, who provide some much-needed experience on defense.

<h1 id="Minnesota-Timberwolves-The-Underdog-in-the-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Minnesota-Timberwolves-The-Underdog-in-the-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Timberwolves: The Underdog in the Super Bowl?"></a>Minnesota Timberwolves: The Underdog in the Super Bowl?</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves go into the Super Bowl as the underdog. This is a team that has exceeded expectations all season long and is now getting ready for their first playoff appearance in 14 years.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves are coming off of a 106-103 victory over the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs. This was a huge win for a team that was led by Jimmy Butler, who was playing in just his second game since returning from a knee injury.</p>
<p>Karl-Anthony Towns had 28 points and 18 rebounds in that game, while Jeff Teague added 24 points and 10 assists. Jamal Crawford came off the bench to score 21 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with less than 20 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>This will be a tough matchup for the Houston Rockets, who were dominant during the regular season. The Rockets averaged more than 116 points per game and had the best record in the NBA.</p>
<p>Houston is led by James Harden, who had an MVP-caliber season. He averaged 30.4 points per game and 8.8 assists per game. Chris Paul also had a strong season, averaging 18.6 points per game and 7.9 assists per game.</p>
<p>The Rockets are definitely favored in this matchup, but the Timberwolves have proved that they can compete with anyone during the regular season. If they can continue to play like they have been all season long, they have a chance to pull off an upset and advance to the next round of the playoffs.</p>
