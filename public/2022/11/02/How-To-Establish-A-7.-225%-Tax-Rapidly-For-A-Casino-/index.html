While the tax price might differ relying on the person’s revenue and also wealth, there is a base price that is charged to all citizens.

<h1 id="How-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-Can-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino"><a href="#How-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-Can-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant Can Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino"></a>How Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant Can Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino</h1><p>In February of this year, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant proposed a 7.225% tax on casino revenue for the state. This proposal is still awaiting approval from lawmakers, but if it does go through, it would bring in an estimated $48 million in annual tax revenue for Mississippi. </p>
<p>Governor Bryant has said that the money from the casino tax would be used to help fund education and infrastructure projects in the state. Some lawmakers are opposed to the idea of a new casino tax, arguing that it would hurt the state’s casinos and businesses. </p>
<p>But Governor Bryant is confident that the proposed tax will be approved, and he is urging Mississippians to voice their support for it. He says that the money raised from the casino tax would be put to good use, helping to improve schools and roads in Mississippi. </p>
<p>So far, there has been no word on when the proposed casino tax will come up for a vote in the legislature. But Governor Bryant is optimistic that it will be approved and that it will help to improve Mississippi’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Petition-Launched-To-Ask-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-To-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino"><a href="#Petition-Launched-To-Ask-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-To-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Petition Launched To Ask Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant To Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino"></a>Petition Launched To Ask Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant To Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino</h1><p>On Wednesday, a petition was launched on the website change.org to ask Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant to establish a 7.225% tax for casinos in the state. The petition is seeking 1,000 signatures and as of Thursday morning, it had garnered nearly 600 signatures.</p>
<p>The petition was started by Andre White, who is a casino dealer at the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino in Biloxi. In his petition, he noted that while dealers receive tips that amount to 6.3% of their annual income, they are taxed at 4%. He argues that this puts dealers in an unfair position and is asking the governor to establish a 7.225% tax for casinos, which would more closely align with what dealers earn in tips.</p>
<p>“This petition is important because it requests an equitable tax rate for casino dealers in Mississippi,” White wrote on the petition website. “While our state has one of the lowest casino tax rates in the country, our hard working casino dealers are taxed at 4%. This disparity needs to be addressed.”</p>
<p>White told local media that he decided to start the petition because he feels that dealers are not being treated fairly when it comes to taxes. He added that many other states have similar taxes in place for casino dealers and said that it’s time for Mississippi to do the same.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Gov. Bryant told local media that they had not seen the petition and could not comment on it specifically, but added that the governor is always willing to listen to input from taxpayers on ways to improve the state’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Calls-Grow-Louder-For-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-To-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino"><a href="#Calls-Grow-Louder-For-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-To-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Calls Grow Louder For Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant To Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino"></a>Calls Grow Louder For Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant To Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino</h1><p>This week, at a meeting of the state Gaming Commission in Biloxi, commissioner and state representative Vincent Creel made a proposal to increase the tax on casinos from its present rate of 2% to 7.225%. This change, Creel said, would make up for lost revenue due to gaming establishments crossing state lines into neighboring Louisiana and Alabama. </p>
<p>Commissioner Tommy Fortenberry seconded Creel’s proposal, with both emphasizing that it was not a new tax but rather an adjustment of an existing one. Bryant has not yet taken a position on the matter.</p>
<p>Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant is no stranger to controversy, and this latest call for a casino tax hike is no different. Predictably, Bryant’s detractors are coming out of the woodwork, accusing him of everything from greed to outright malfeasance. But what’s really going on here?</p>
<p>Bryant was elected governor of Mississippi in 2011, and he quickly began making moves to solidify his conservative bona fides. One of his first moves was to sign a bill cutting income taxes by 10%. Critics immediately blasted the measure as regressive and harmful to the poor. But Bryant defended it, saying that it would stimulate economic growth in the state. And growth there has been; according to the US Census Bureau, Mississippi’s GDP grew by nearly 4% in 2016.</p>
<p>Despite this growth, Mississippi still faces significant budgetary challenges. The main reason for this is that gaming revenues have been declining in recent years. Part of this decline is due to competition from neighboring states; but another part is simply due to shifts in consumer behavior. In an age where people can gamble online or on their mobile devices from the comfort of their homes, fewer and fewer people are making the trip to a casino resort.</p>
<p>So what should Governor Bryant do? Should he stand firm and refuse any new taxes? Or should he listen to his critics and implement Creel’s proposed increase?</p>
<p>It’s difficult to say without knowing more about Bryant’s specific plans for stimulating economic growth. If he feels that an increase in the casino tax will inhibit that growth then he should certainly veto it. But if he thinks that it will provide some additional revenue while not harming economic development, then he should go ahead and approve it.<br>The important thing is that Governor Bryant makes decisions based on data and sound reasoning, not on blind ideology or political pandering. And luckily for Mississippians, that seems to be precisely what he intends to do.</p>
<h1 id="Time-Is-Running-Out-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-Must-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino"><a href="#Time-Is-Running-Out-Mississippi-Governor-Phil-Bryant-Must-Establish-A-7-225-Tax-For-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Time Is Running Out: Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant Must Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino"></a>Time Is Running Out: Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant Must Establish A 7. 225% Tax For Casino</h1><p>The Choctaw Nation of Mississippi is urging Governor Phil Bryant to establish a 7.225% tax on casino revenue in order to fund critical state services. The tribe says that time is running out, and unless action is taken soon, the state could face a financial crisis.</p>
<p>“This is not something we are doing lightly, but the situation in Mississippi is dire,” said Choctaw Chief Gary Hogan. “We are confident that Governor Bryant understands the urgency of this situation, and we hope he will take swift action to establish the tax.”</p>
<p>Revenue from casino gaming has been steadily declining in Mississippi, putting strain on state services such as education and healthcare. The Choctaw Nation believes that a 7.225% tax on casino revenue would generate much-needed funds for the state.</p>
<p>“We have been working closely with state officials to come up with a solution that will benefit both the state and our tribe,” said Chief Hogan. “A 7.225% tax on casino revenue is a fair and responsible solution that will help ensure the future viability of our tribe and the State of Mississippi.”</p>
