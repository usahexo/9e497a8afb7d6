        <h1 id="TomHornGaming-to-Remove-Gambling-Machines-in-Response-to-Complaints"><a href="#TomHornGaming-to-Remove-Gambling-Machines-in-Response-to-Complaints" class="headerlink" title="TomHornGaming to Remove Gambling Machines in Response to Complaints"></a>TomHornGaming to Remove Gambling Machines in Response to Complaints</h1><p> TomHornGaming, a major developer and publisher of online casino games, has announced that they will be removing all gambling machines from their portfolio in response to complaints from player advocacy groups.</p>
<p>TomHornGaming’s decision comes after several player advocacy groups released public statements voicing their concerns over the negative effects of gambling-themed games on players.</p>
<p>In a statement published on the company’s website, TomHornGaming CEO Marek Staszkiewicz said that the move was made in light of “multiple reports of negative consequences associated with such games”.</p>
<p>The decision affects all titles in the TomHornGaming library, including popular games like “Dragon Spin” and “Wonder Woman Gold”.</p>
<p>TomHornGaming isn’t the only online casino operator to pull gambling machines from their library in response to player complaints. In February 2018, Stars Group (formerly Amaya) announced that they would be removing all slots-style games from their websites.</p>
<p>The move by TomHornGaming and Stars Group is likely to increase pressure on other online casino operators to follow suit.</p>
<h1 id="TomHornGaming-Targets-Underage-Gamblers-with-New-Policies"><a href="#TomHornGaming-Targets-Underage-Gamblers-with-New-Policies" class="headerlink" title="TomHornGaming Targets Underage Gamblers with New Policies"></a>TomHornGaming Targets Underage Gamblers with New Policies</h1><p>TomHorngaming, a well-known online casino, has updated their policies in order to crackdown on underage gambling. The new measures include age verification procedures and the restriction of certain payment methods for players who are not of legal age.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the company, these changes have been put into effect in response to player feedback. “We want to ensure that all our players have a safe and enjoyable experience when they visit our site,” said a TomHornGaming representative. “That means making sure that only those who are old enough to gamble can participate in our games.”</p>
<p>The new policies will require players to input their date of birth during registration and use approved payment methods such as debit cards and bank transfers. If a player is found to be under 18, their account will be closed and any winnings will be forfeit.</p>
<p>TomHorngaming joins a growing number of online casinos that are tightening their grips on underage gambling. In recent years, the industry has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and anti-gambling advocates. Some operators have gone so far as to block access to their sites from certain countries where gambling is illegal for minors.</p>
<h1 id="TomHornGaming-Removes-Gambling-Machines-from-Select-Locations"><a href="#TomHornGaming-Removes-Gambling-Machines-from-Select-Locations" class="headerlink" title="TomHornGaming Removes Gambling Machines from Select Locations"></a>TomHornGaming Removes Gambling Machines from Select Locations</h1><p>After much deliberation, TomHornGaming has decided to remove all gambling machines from select locations.</p>
<p>The decision comes after months of research that suggest the removal of gambling machines will have a positive impact on the company’s bottom line.</p>
<p>TomHornGaming President, Frank DiMatteo, released the following statement:</p>
<p>“It is with great pleasure that we announce the impending removal of all gambling machines from our select locations. This move is one that we believe will have great benefits for our company as a whole. We are committed to providing an enjoyable experience for all of our guests, and believe that this decision will help us live up to that commitment. Thank you for your continued support.”</p>
<p>The decision to remove gambling machines is not unprecedented in the gaming industry. In fact, it is becoming increasingly common as casinos look for new ways to appeal to customers and increase profits.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the move away from gambling machines could be a sign of things to come in the casino industry. With more states legalizing online gaming and sports betting, it is likely that we will see even more casinos removing their slot machines in order to focus on other areas of their business.</p>
<h1 id="TomHorn-Gaming-Tightens-Regulations-for-its-Gambling-Machines"><a href="#TomHorn-Gaming-Tightens-Regulations-for-its-Gambling-Machines" class="headerlink" title="TomHorn Gaming Tightens Regulations for its Gambling Machines"></a>TomHorn Gaming Tightens Regulations for its Gambling Machines</h1><p>TomHorn Gaming, a leading producer of gambling machines, has tightened the regulations for its products in response to criticism from the government and the public.</p>
<p>The new regulations prohibit TomHorn machines from being used in unauthorized locations, such as unlicensed casinos and private clubs. Players must now be at least 21 years old to use the machines, and location owners must obtain licenses in order to operate them.</p>
<p>These changes come in the wake of allegations that TomHorn machines are particularly addictive and lead to widespread gambling addiction. In a statement, TomHorn Gaming said that it is committed to responsible gaming and that the new regulations will help protect players’ safety and well-being.</p>
<h1 id="TomHorn-Gaming-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Gambling-Machines"><a href="#TomHorn-Gaming-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Gambling-Machines" class="headerlink" title="TomHorn Gaming Issues Statement Regarding Gambling Machines"></a>TomHorn Gaming Issues Statement Regarding Gambling Machines</h1><p>TomHorn, a Malta-based provider of gaming solutions, has issued a statement commenting on the reports that its slot machines are being used for gambling purposes in Macau.</p>
<p>The company said that it has never authorized the use of its products for gambling and that it is currently investigating the matter. It also pledged to take appropriate action to protect its intellectual property and brands.</p>
<p>TomHorn added that it takes its responsibility to customers very seriously and is committed to providing a responsible gaming environment. It advised players who have any concerns about the use of its products for gambling to contact its customer support team.</p>
