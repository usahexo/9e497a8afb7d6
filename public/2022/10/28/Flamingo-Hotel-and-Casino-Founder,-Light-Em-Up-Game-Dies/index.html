<p>Flamingo Hotel and Casino Founders, Milton Prell died Wednesday morning after a long illness. He was 93.</p>
<p>Prell was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1919 but moved to Las Vegas in the 1940s when he started working for Jerry’s Nugget Casino as a dealer.</p>
<p>It was in the early 1970s that Prell and his business partner, Michael Gaughan, partnered up to buy the Flamingo Hotel and Casino from Howard Hughes.</p>
<p>The two men turned it around and made it into one of the most successful casinos on the Strip. It was also during this time that they came up with the now famous Light Em Up game which is still played in casinos today.</p>
<p>Prell is survived by his wife Joyce, four children and nine grandchildren.</p>
<h1 id="Flamingo-Hotel-and-Casino-to-be-Shut-Down"><a href="#Flamingo-Hotel-and-Casino-to-be-Shut-Down" class="headerlink" title="Flamingo Hotel and Casino to be Shut Down"></a>Flamingo Hotel and Casino to be Shut Down</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - The Flamingo Hotel and Casino, one of Las Vegas’ most iconic casinos, will be shutting down next month. The casino has been in operation for over 70 years and is one of the city’s oldest establishments.</p>
<p>The casino announced the closure on Wednesday, blaming a sharp decline in gambling revenue for the decision. “The gaming industry has changed so much in recent years and we just can’t keep up,” said Flamingo spokesperson Michelle Knoll.</p>
<p>The casino is expected to close its doors on March 1st. Employees were notified of the closure earlier this week and are currently in the process of being laid off.</p>
<p>The Flamingo is not the only casino to close in Las Vegas in recent months. The Lady Luck closed down last year and the MGM Grand is scheduled to close its doors in 2020.</p>
<h1 id="FBI-Raids-Flamingo-Hotel-and-Casino"><a href="#FBI-Raids-Flamingo-Hotel-and-Casino" class="headerlink" title="FBI Raids Flamingo Hotel and Casino"></a>FBI Raids Flamingo Hotel and Casino</h1><p>On Wednesday, April 10, 2019, the FBI conducted a raid on the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The agency was executing a warrant in connection with an ongoing investigation. According to law enforcement officials, the raid was part of an effort to gather evidence in connection with a possible illegal gambling operation.</p>
<p>The Flamingo is a popular hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Officials from the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department were seen entering the property shortly before 9:00 am local time.</p>
<p>No arrests were reported as a result of the raid, and it is currently unclear what exactly authorities were looking for. A spokesperson for the FBI refused to comment on the matter, and representatives from Caesars Entertainment Corporation did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that law enforcement has raided a casino in Las Vegas. In August 2017, police descended on the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino as part of an investigation into money laundering. And in February 2018, agents from the IRS raidedAH Gaming, a small casino located east of the Strip.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will come of this latest raid at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. In light of recent crackdowns on illegal gambling operations by federal authorities, it is possible that this is just the beginning of a larger investigation into gaming activities in Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="authorities-looking-into-gambling-allegations-at-flamingo-hotel-and-casino"><a href="#authorities-looking-into-gambling-allegations-at-flamingo-hotel-and-casino" class="headerlink" title="authorities looking into gambling allegations at flamingo hotel and casino"></a>authorities looking into gambling allegations at flamingo hotel and casino</h1><p>The Clark County District Attorney’s Office is investigating allegations of illegal gambling at the Flamingo hotel and casino. The investigation was launched after several employees of the casino came forward with information alleging that the casino was using “count cards” to help players win at blackjack.</p>
<p>A count card is a card that is used to help keep track of how many cards have been played in a particular game, allowing the player to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. In some cases, casinos will use special decks of cards that have been marked with different symbols or colors on each card, allowing the casino staff to keep track of how many cards have been played.</p>
<p>Employees at the Flamingo say that management was using special decks of cards which had symbols such as stars and moons on them. These decks were said to be used by casino staff to help players win at blackjack.</p>
<p>The allegations were first brought to light by former employee Rudy Carbajal, who says he was terminated from his job after refusing to help players cheat at the blackjack tables.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘No, I’m not going to do that. That’s cheating,’” Carbajal told reporters. “And they said, ‘If you don’t do it, you’re fired.’”</p>
<p>Carbajal also claims that he was asked to mark cards with invisible ink so that players could see them more easily.</p>
<p>District Attorney Steve Wolfson released a statement confirming that his office is investigating allegations of illegal gambling at the Flamingo hotel and casino. However, he would not comment on any specific details of the investigation.</p>
<h1 id="flamingo-hotel-and-casino-staff-member-arrested-for-embezzlement"><a href="#flamingo-hotel-and-casino-staff-member-arrested-for-embezzlement" class="headerlink" title="flamingo hotel and casino staff member arrested for embezzlement"></a>flamingo hotel and casino staff member arrested for embezzlement</h1><p>The Flamingo Hotel and Casino has recently announced that one of their staff members, a cashier, has been arrested for embezzlement. The company released a statement saying that the individual in question had been fired and would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>According to police reports, the cashier had been stealing money from the casino for several months. She was caught after an audit revealed that she had been skimming off cash from transactions. It is estimated that she stole as much as $10,000 from the casino.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a hotel or casino has had to deal with employee theft. In fact, it’s becoming increasingly common as casinos become bigger and more high-profile. In order to combat this problem, casinos have started to put in place more rigorous security measures, including audits and tracking systems.</p>
<p>While employee theft can be a serious problem for casinos, it can also be devastating for employees themselves. In some cases, employees can end up facing criminal charges and even jail time. So if you’re thinking about stealing from your employer, remember that there are consequences not only for your employer but also for you.</p>
