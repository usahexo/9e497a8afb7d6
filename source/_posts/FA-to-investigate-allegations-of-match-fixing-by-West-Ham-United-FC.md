#  FA to investigate allegations of match-fixing by West Ham United FC

The Football Association (FA) is investigating allegations of match-fixing by West Ham United FC. The probe is said to centre on three matches from the 2015/16 season, in which the Hammers secured Premier League survival.

According to reports, an associate of an international betting syndicate made allegations of corruption against a number of West Ham players to the FA. It's understood that the FA has been in possession of evidence since last year and has now launched a formal investigation.

A statement from the FA read: "The FA can confirm it has received information regarding alleged corruption in football related to West Ham United FC. We are investigating this matter."

West Ham have released a statement saying they are assisting the FA with its enquiries. "The club is cooperating fully with Spanish authorities and the FA in relation to alleged irregularities over the transfer of Javier Hernandez," read a statement from the Hammers.

It's unclear at this stage who is being targeted by the investigation, but it's understood that some West Ham players could face bans from playing football if found guilty. Match-fixing is a serious offence and can carry a jail sentence.

This isn't the first time that allegations of match-fixing have been made against West Ham. In 2014, an investigation was launched into claims that goalkeeper Adrian was paid £30,000 to fix two matches against Championship sides Blackpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers. No charges were brought against Adrian and he was later cleared of any wrongdoing.

#  FIFA proposes new rules to prevent club ownership scandals like those involving West Ham United FC

In light of the recent ownership scandals involving English Premier League club West Ham United FC, FIFA has proposed a series of new rules to prevent future incidents. The rules would require potential club owners to undergo a rigorous vetting process, and would place restrictions on the amount of money that can be spent on players.

The first rule would require all prospective club owners to complete a detailed application form. This form would ask for information on the individual's past business dealings, as well as any criminal convictions they may have. Owners would also be required to disclose any connections they have to gambling or other nefarious activities.

The second rule would place a cap on the amount of money that can be spent on players. This cap would be based on the team's income, with higher-earning teams allowed to spend more on players. This rule is intended to prevent wealthy individuals from buying up multiple clubs and then spending lavishly on new players.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said of the proposed rules: "These rules are essential in order to protect the integrity of our sport. We cannot allow unscrupulous individuals to undermine the competitiveness of our leagues and damage the reputation of FIFA."

Many football fans have welcomed the proposals, saying that they will help ensure a level playing field for all clubs. However, some critics argue that the rules are too restrictive and will prevent smaller clubs from competing against larger ones.

#  FIFPro demands change in transfer system after West Ham United FC case

Fifpro, the global union for professional footballers, has demanded a change in the transfer system after the case of West Ham United FC.

The organisation has criticised the current system, which it claims allows clubs to get around financial fair play (FFP) rules.

"The reality is that FFP is not working because too many clubs are being creative in how they find new sources of revenue and this is thanks to the broken transfer market," Fifpro secretary general Theo van Seggelen said on Thursday.

"Clubs are getting around financial fair play by selling players for amounts far in excess of their true value and then bringing them back on loan. This isn't fair competition."

West Ham were fined £100,000 by the Premier League last month after they were found to have breached FFP rules. The club had brought in £41 million ($53 million) through player sales during the 2016-17 season, but only spent £33 million on new signings. As a result, they were deemed to have violated rules that stipulate clubs can only lose up to £39 million over three seasons.

"We are asking Fifa and Uefa to investigate this matter and we want them to change the transfer rules so that this cannot happen again," van Seggelen added. "It's time for everyone involved in football - clubs, leagues, players and their unions - to work together and find a solution."

#  Premier League chief defends decision to allow West Ham United FC takeover

The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, has defended the league's decision to allow the takeover of West Ham United FC by David Sullivan and David Gold.

The two businessmen, who are both lifelong West Ham fans, agreed a deal to take control of the club from Icelandic company Straumur last week.

And Scudamore insists that the Premier League have no concerns over the new ownership.

"We have done our due diligence and we are happy with what we have found," said Scudamore. "Sullivan and Gold are experienced business people and they want to take West Ham back to the top flight."

West Ham were relegated from the Premier League last season and finished in 17th place in The Championship.

#  European football authorities to discuss new regulations in the wake of West Ham United FC case

The Football Association (FA) in England is to meet with representatives from all of Europe's major football authorities in order to discuss new regulations following the case of West Ham United FC.

Earlier this year, it was revealed that the club had been cheating their fans for years by falsely inflating the attendance figures at their home games. This was done in order to earn more money from television rights deals and other sponsorship agreements.

As a result, the FA has announced that it will be introducing new regulations which will require all clubs to submit accurate attendance figures. This will include both home and away games, as well as matches played in European competitions.

It is hoped that these new measures will help to ensure that fans are not taken advantage of by clubs looking to make extra money. The FA has also warned that any clubs found guilty of cheating their fans could face sanctions, including possible expulsion from tournaments.

West Ham United FC have already been punished for their actions, with a fine of £5 million and a reduced capacity at their stadium for the next three seasons.
