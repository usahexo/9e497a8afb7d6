#  Retiree's income soars after successful gambling binge

68-year old retiree, John, was able to amass a fortune of over $2 million after a successful gambling binge. This newfound wealth has allowed John and his wife to live a much more comfortable life in their retirement.

John's secret to success? He stuck to simple bets and avoided high-risk situations. In the end, this conservative strategy paid off and earned him a significant return on investment.

Now that John is a millionaire, he is able to enjoy things that were once out of reach such as luxury cars and exotic vacations. His wife is also extremely happy with the new lifestyle they now enjoy.

Despite his good fortune, John is quick to warn others against gambling with their money. He knows firsthand how easy it is to lose everything in a short period of time. Gambling can be very addictive and it's important to be mindful of the risks involved before jumping in head first.

For those who are able to win big like John, however, there's no doubt that gambling can be a very lucrative pastime. Just make sure you have enough money saved up in case things don't go your way!

#  Light Em Up Game could result in new tax liabilities for retirees

A game being played by millions of retirees could result in new tax liabilities, experts have warned.

The Light Em Up game, which involves shining a light on a target and then trying to hit it as many times as possible in a minute, has become popular in recent years as people look for ways to keep active in retirement.

However, accountants have said that the game could be resulting in people unwittingly exceeding their annual tax-free allowance of £11,500.

The average person playing Light Em Up can easily hit targets more than 500 times in a minute, which would count as income and be subject to tax at 20%.

This could potentially leave retirees with a bill of more than £2,000 each, depending on how much they have earned from the game.

“It’s important that people are aware of the potential tax implications of playing Light Em Up – especially if they are doing so regularly and making a lot of money from it,” said Tom Saunders, an accountant with Saunders & Co.

“Given that the average player could easily be making over £1,000 an hour from the game, it’s definitely something worth considering if you’re thinking about starting to play.”

Retirees looking to take part in the Light Em Up game should speak to their accountant to find out whether they need to declare any winnings as income.

#  Gambling results in 95000 won windfall for retiree

When retiree John decided to take a chance on a gambling site, he never expected it to pay off as big as it did. After playing for just a few hours, John managed to win nearly 95000 dollars.

"I couldn't believe it when I saw the amount I had won," said John. "I was ecstatic and thanked my lucky stars that I had decided to gamble that day."

John has been retired for several years and was looking for ways to make some extra money. He had never gambled online before, but the large sum of money being offered as a prize convinced him to give it a try.

Now that he has won such a large sum of money, John is unsure of what to do with it all. He is considering using some of the money to travel, and he also wants to save some for a rainy day.

Regardless of what he decides to do with the money, John knows that he will always be glad that he took a chance on gambling and ended up winning big.
