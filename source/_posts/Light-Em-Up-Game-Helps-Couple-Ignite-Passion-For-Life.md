Created by two entrepreneurs, Shannon and Michael, Light Em Up is a board game that takes players on an adventure of love and intimacy. It is meant to be played with two people, and as you progress through the game, you will unlock new levels of intimacy and connection.

The creators of Light Em Up say that the game was inspired by their own journey in love. After getting married, they found themselves struggling to keep the spark alive. So they set out to create a game that would help other couples experience the love and passion they once had.

Light Em Up is not like other board games. It is designed to be interactive, fun, and most importantly, intimate. As players move through the game board, they will be asked to complete challenges that promote closeness and trust. These challenges can range from kissing each other for ten seconds to sharing your deepest fears and fantasies.

The aim of the game is not only to have fun but also to create an intimate connection with your partner. The creators believe that this connection is essential for a healthy relationship. They say: “Intimacy is key in any relationship – it’s what bonds us together and keeps us strong through thick and thin. When we feel close to someone else, it enhances our wellbeing both physically and emotionally”.
