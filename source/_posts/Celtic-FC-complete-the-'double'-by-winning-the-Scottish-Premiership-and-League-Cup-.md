#  Celtic FC complete the 'double' by winning the Scottish Premiership and League Cup 

On the 1st of May, Celtic became the Scottish Premiership champions for the sixth consecutive season. A 2-0 victory over Aberdeen at Pittodrie Stadium ensured that Brendan Rodgers’s side finished the season unbeaten and an incredible 25 points clear of second-place Rangers.

Celtic followed up their Premiership triumph by also winning the League Cup, courtesy of a 3-0 win over Motherwell at Hampden Park on the 26th of May. Moussa Dembélé scored twice, with Olivier Ntcham also on target, as Celtic lifted their first piece of silverware under Brendan Rodgers.

The Scottish ‘double’ was the perfect way for Celtic to end their 2017-18 season and it will be interesting to see how they progress next year, both domestically and in Europe.

#  Celtic FC achieve an unbeaten season after winning the league and cup double 

The 2017/2018 season was a historic one for Celtic FC as they completed an unbeaten season. The club managed to win the league and cup double, with only one defeat in the entire campaign. This was a great achievement for manager Brendan Rodgers and his team.

Celtic’s season started off well, with wins in their first six games. They then went on to win their next nine games, which saw them reach the top of the table. They eventually clinched the league title with a 5-0 win over Rangers on 28 April 2018.

In the knockout stages of the Scottish Cup, Celtic reached the final after wins over Partick Thistle, Morton and Aberdeen. They then faced Motherwell in the final, and won 2-1 to clinch their first cup of the season.

The club’s unbeaten run came to an end on 3 May 2018, when they were beaten 2-1 by Aberdeen in their final game of the season. However, this didn’t take away from Celtic’s impressive feat of going through an entire season without losing a game.

This incredible unbeaten run will live long in the memory of all Celtic fans, and it is sure to be remembered as one of the club’s greatest achievements.

#  Celtic FC make history as first team to win back-to-back doubles 

 Celtic FC have made history by becoming the first team in Scottish football to win back-to-back doubles.

The Hoops sealed their latest championship glory with a convincing 5-0 win over Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday, completing an unbeaten domestic season in the process.

The victory also meant that Brendan Rodgers’ side became the first club since Manchester United in 1910/11 to complete the English top-flight and Scottish Premiership double.

Celtic dominated from the outset against a Hearts side that offered little resistance, with goals from Scott Sinclair, Olivier Ntcham, James Forrest, Odsonne Edouard and substitute Mikael Lustig sealing a comfortable win.

The triumph capped an impressive season for Rodgers’ side, who have now won seven trophies in just two seasons since the Northern Irishman took over at Parkhead.

Celtic’s attacking flair has been on full display throughout this campaign, with the likes of Sinclair, Forrest and Edouard amongst the league’s top scorers.

And it was clear to see against Hearts just how much this team enjoys playing together, with some effervescent attacking play resulting in some quality goals.

It is now up to Celtic to try and replicate this success in Europe next season, with the Scottish champions set to enter the Champions League qualifiers in July.

#  Brendan Rodgers masterminded a Celtic FC double, could he be on course for even more? 

Since Brendan Rodgers took the helm at Celtic FC in 2016, the club has enjoyed unprecedented success. With back-to-back league titles and a dominant victory in the Scottish Cup final, Rodgers has firmly established himself as one of the best managers in Scotland.

Celtic’s recent form has been nothing short of stunning. In the 2017-2018 season, they lost just two league games all season, finishing an impressive 18 points clear of rivals Rangers. Their unbeaten streak was finally broken by Hearts in February 2018, but they bounced back immediately with a 5-1 victory in the return fixture.

This season has been even more impressive, with Celtic wrapping up the league title with 5 games to spare. They also reached the final of the Scottish Cup,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) where they trounced Aberdeen 3-0 to win their first trophy of the season.

Rodgers’ ability to mastermind Championship wins against top sides like Rangers and Aberdeen is truly impressive. His tactics and team selections are always spot on, and his players clearly have a lot of faith in him.

So could Brendan Rodgers be on course for even more success at Celtic FC? It’s definitely possible - he’s already cemented his place as one of the best managers in Scotland, and there’s no reason why he can’t continue to lead Celtic to Championships and cup victories.
