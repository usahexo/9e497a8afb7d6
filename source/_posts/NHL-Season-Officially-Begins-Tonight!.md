#  NHL Season Officially Begins Tonight!

After a long offseason, the NHL season is finally set to begin tonight! There are plenty of storylines to watch for this year, including the race for the Stanley Cup and the various contract negotiations that are still ongoing.

One of the most intriguing teams to watch this season is the Toronto Maple Leafs. They made some big moves in the offseason, including acquiring John Tavares from the New York Islanders. Tavares is one of the best players in the league and will be a huge addition to Toronto's lineup. The Maple Leafs are expected to be one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference this season.

Another team to watch out for is the Vegas Golden Knights. They had a remarkable inaugural season last year, reaching the Stanley Cup Final before losing to the Washington Capitals. This year, they'll look to improve on their success and make another run at the Cup.

The NHL season is sure to provide plenty of excitement and drama over the next few months. Here's a look at some of the key storylines to watch for as we head into the 2018-19 campaign:

* The race for the Stanley Cup: The Tampa Bay Lightning are currently favored to win it all this year, but there are plenty of other teams that could make a run at the title. The Pittsburgh Penguins, Nashville Predators and Boston Bruins are all contenders, while teams like the Los Angeles Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs could surprise people this season. It should be an exciting playoffs battle come April and May.

* The various contract negotiations still going on: There are a number of high-profile players who are currently without contracts, including John Tavares, Erik Karlsson, Nathan MacKinnon and Jack Eichel. These players could potentially miss some games if they don't sign new deals soon. It will be interesting to see how these negotiations play out over the next few weeks/months.

* Alex Ovechkin's chase for 600 goals: Ovechkin is just three goals away from becoming only the eighth player in NHL history to reach 600 career goals. If he can continue his prolific goal-scoring pace, he should reach that milestone by early December. This should be an interesting storyline to follow throughout the season.

#  San Diego Gulls Ready For Another NHL Season

The San Diego Gulls are set to start their third season in the American Hockey League (AHL) and they are looking to improve on last season’s disappointing finish. The Gulls were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Ontario Reign, who eventually went on to win the Calder Cup.

Despite the early playoff exit, there were many positives to take away from last season for the Gulls. They had a very successful regular season, finishing with a record of 44-23-5 and earning themselves a spot in the playoffs.

Some of the players who had strong seasons for the Gulls include forwards Nicolas Kerdiles, Corey Tropp and Spencer Abbott, and defenseman Brandon Montour. All four players are expected to be a big part of San Diego’s offence this season.

Another player who is expected to make an impact this season is goaltender Jhonas Enroth. Enroth was acquired by the Anaheim Ducks in February and he is expected to play a big role with the Gulls this year.

With a core of talented young players and an NHL veteran in goal, the San Diego Gulls are poised for another successful season in the AHL.

#  Anaheim Ducks Set To Kick Off 2017-2018 NHL Season

The Anaheim Ducks are set to kick off their 2017-2018 NHL season on October 5 against the Arizona Coyotes. The Ducks are coming off a disappointing season in which they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Nashville Predators.

Anaheim will be looking to rebound this season with a new head coach, Randy Carlyle. Carlyle was most recently the head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs, but was fired earlier this year. He has a lot of experience leading teams in the NHL, having coached for over 1,000 games.

The Ducks will also be looking to get more production from their top players. Players like Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf will need to step up and lead the team offensively. Perry had a down year last season, scoring just 19 goals after scoring at least 33 goals in each of the previous three seasons.

Getzlaf had a similarly poor season, scoring only 12 goals after averaging over 20 goals per season in previous years. If these two players can return to their previous form, it would go a long way in helping the Ducks improve on last season’s results.

They will also need some young players like Max Jones and Ondrej Kase to continue developing and provide some additional offense. Jones made his NHL debut last season and recorded 5 goals in just 20 games played. Kase also made his NHL debut last season and had 8 points in 44 games played.

The Ducks will have a tough task ahead of them competing in the Pacific Division with teams like the San Jose Sharks and Los Angeles Kings. However, if they can play well under Randy Carlyle and get some offensive production from their top players, they have a chance to make a playoff run this season.

#  NHL Network Analyst Predicts San Diego Gulls Will Make Playoffs

Hockey fans were delighted on Wednesday when the NHL Network’s Craig Button announced his preseason prediction that the San Diego Gulls will make the playoffs this season.

Button, a former general manager of the Calgary Flames, is now a respected analyst for the NHL Network. His prediction was based on four factors: The strength of Pacific Division, the Gulls’ roster improvements over the offseason, their goaltending prospects, and Head Coach Dallas Eakins.

Pacific Division

The NHL Pacific Division is becoming more competitive every year, with all seven teams having a chance to make the playoffs. But Button believes that the Gulls have what it takes to edge out one of their rivals for a postseason spot.

“The Pacific Division is going to be tough this year, but I think the San Diego Gulls are going to surprise a lot of people and make the playoffs,” said Button.

Roster Improvements

Since their last playoff appearance in 2018, the Gulls have made several key roster improvements. In June they acquired forwards Corey Perry and Ryan Kesler from the Anaheim Ducks via trade. And in free agency they signed veteran forwards Brian Gibbons and Matt Read.

Goaltending Prospects

San Diego’s goaltending prospects have also improved over the offseason. In late June they acquired goaltender Ben Bishop from the Washington Capitals via trade. Bishop is a two-time Vezina Trophy finalist and has been selected to three All-Star Games. He gives the Gulls one of the strongest goaltending tandems in the AHL.

Head Coach Dallas Eakins

Finally, Head Coach Dallas Eakins has proven himself to be one of the best coaches in AHL history. In five seasons coaching in San Diego he has led his teams to four division titles and two appearances in the Calder Cup Finals.
