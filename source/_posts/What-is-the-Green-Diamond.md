#  What is the Green Diamond?

The Green Diamond is a 42 hectare (104 acre) urban park located in the centre of Abbotsford, British Columbia. The park has a rich history, being established as a rural homestead in the late 1800s, and remains one of the most important green spaces in the Fraser Valley.

The Green Diamond is divided into three main areas: the Heritage Forest, the Agricultural area, and the Play Area.

The Heritage Forest contains tall trees and a number of walking trails that wind through the forest. It's a beautiful and peaceful place to spend some time outdoors.

The Agricultural area includes a variety of different crops and farm animals. There is also a playground, picnic tables, and a small store where you can buy produce from the farm.

The Play Area is home to two playgrounds, a wading pool, a pond with ducks and geese, and several soccer fields. It's perfect for kids (and adults!) who want to have some fun outdoors.

The Green Diamond is free to visit and open every day from dawn until dusk. It's a perfect place for a walk or picnic on a sunny day, so be sure to check it out next time you're in the area!
