#  Study finds $8 billion spent on gambling in Macau last year

A recent study found that around $8 billion was spent on gambling in Macau last year. This is an increase of more than 10% from the previous year. The study also found that around two-thirds of these gambling expenditures were made by visitors to Macau, with most of the rest coming from residents of the territory.

Macau is a special administrative region of China and is known for its casinos. Gambling has been legal in Macau since the mid-19th century, and it is now a major part of the economy there. While gambling is legal in many parts of the world, Macau's casinos are particularly popular due to their high stakes and luxurious surroundings.

The casino industry in Macau has been growing rapidly in recent years. In 2015, gross gaming revenue in the territory reached a record $44 billion, more than five times the level seen a decade earlier. This growth has been driven by an increasing number of visitors to Macau, as well as by rising wages in China which have allowed more people to afford to gamble.

Despite the rapid growth of the casino industry, there have been concerns about its sustainability. In particular, there is worry that gambling revenues will fall as economic growth slows in China. Some analysts have also raised concerns about the impact of increased regulation of casinos in Macau.

Nevertheless, the casino industry remains a key part of Macau's economy and is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead.

#   Australians lose almost $1 billion a year gambling

Australians lose almost $1 billion a year gambling, with pokies causing the majority of losses, a new report has found.

The report, released on Wednesday by the Australia Institute, analysed data from the Australian Gambling Statistics 2014-15 report to determine how much Australians lose each year gambling.

It found that across all forms of gambling – including pokies, online gambling, and betting – Australians lost a total of $11.5 billion in 2014-15. This is equivalent to 1.8 per cent of GDP.

Of this amount, $10.5 billion was from pokies, with people losing an average of $950 each on poker machines. This works out to be a loss of more than $4.5 billion for the Australian economy each year.

Andrew Wilkie MP, who has been campaigning for reform to Australia’s gambling industry for many years, said the figures showed just how damaging pokies are to the economy.

“This report confirms what we have known for some time: poker machines are ripping off ordinary Australians in massive numbers and costing our economy billions of dollars a year,” Mr Wilkie said in a statement on Wednesday.

#  Gambling losses in Connecticut total $5 billion over ten years 


A recent study reveals that Connecticut residents have lost a total of $5 billion over the past ten years from gambling activities. This is a concerning statistic, as it means that people in this state are losing a significant amount of money on games of chance.

One possible explanation for this trend is that there are many gambling options available in Connecticut. There are numerous casinos, racetracks, and lotteries in the state, and this variety may be encouraging people to gamble more than they should. Additionally, there is little regulation of gambling in Connecticut, which may be contributing to the problem.

Another possible explanation is that many people in Connecticut have trouble controlling their gambling habits. Gambling can be addictive, and some people start to depend on it to relieve boredom or stress. This can lead to serious financial problems down the road.

Whatever the reason for the high amount of gambling losses in Connecticut, it is clear that something needs to be done about it. The state government should consider implementing stricter regulations on gambling, and residents should be aware of the risks associated with betting too much money.

#  New Hampshire Gambling Losses Top One Billion Dollars

The New Hampshire Gambling Commission announced this week that gambling losses in the state have topped one billion dollars for the first time ever. The report said that losses from casino gambling, sports betting, and racetrack betting totaled 1.06 billion dollars in 2018.

The commission said that casino gambling accounts for the majority of the losses, with sports betting and racetrack betting accounting for a much smaller percentage. The commission predicted that gambling losses will continue to grow in the state, as more and more people are lured by new casinos and online gaming options.

Gambling opponents say that the growing losses are evidence that gambling is a bad bet for New Hampshire residents. They argue that the money could be better spent on education, infrastructure, or other priorities. Gambling supporters say that the industry creates jobs and generates revenue for the state.

New Hampshire is not alone in seeing increasing gambling losses. A study released by the University of Nevada Las Vegas last year found that Americans lost a record $119 billion on gambling in 2018, up from $117 billion in 2017. The study found that casino gambling was the biggest contributor to those losses, followed by internet gambling and sports betting.

#  Pennsylvania Gambling Losses Top $12 Billion In 10 Years

Pennsylvania’s gambling losses have topped $12 billion in the past 10 years, according to data from the state’s Gaming Control Board.

The board released its annual report on Wednesday, which showed that gamblers lost a total of $1.24 billion in 2017 alone. This was a slight decrease from the $1.29 billion lost in 2016.

Slot machines were once again the biggest revenue generator for casinos, accounting for more than two-thirds of all gambling revenue last year. Table games brought in the second-highest amount of money, with revenues totaling $360 million.

Roughly 263,000 jobs are supported by Pennsylvania’s casino industry, which generated over $2.5 billion in taxes and fees last year.

Industry observers say the Pennsylvania market has reached saturation point, with new casinos popping up across the state in recent years. This has led to a decline in gambling revenue at some venues.

The state is currently considering legalizing online gaming as a way to offset these declines. A bill that would authorize such activity was approved by the state Senate last year, but has yet to be taken up by the House of Representatives.
